# portfolio-website

This is my personal portfolio website created to showcase my learning journey in web development.  
It includes my projects, skills, and experiments that I am building while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The purpose of this portfolio is not just to display finished work, but to track my growth, practice real-world development, and improve my problem-solving skills by building projects side by side.

More features and projects will be added as I continue learning.
